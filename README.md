<h1>Flask Web App</h1>
The Note Application is a full-stack web application that allows users to manage personal notes with features such as login, signup, and logout functionalities. It is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, delivering a responsive and user-friendly interface. On the backend, the application utilizes Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, to handle server-side logic and user authentication.

Users can register using their email ID and password, securely store their credentials, and log in to access personalized notes. Once logged in, they can create, edit, and delete notes, with each action being reflected immediately in the database, which is managed using Flask's ORM (Object Relational Mapping) or direct database connections such as SQLite or MySQL.

The application ensures the integrity and security of user data with proper session management and implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations efficiently. Flask handles routing and interactions with the backend, while SQLAlchemy or a similar database management tool is used for persisting user data and notes. The integration between the frontend and backend ensures smooth data flow, providing users with a seamless experience.
